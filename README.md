# Super Voice Assistant

macOS voice assistant with global hotkeys - transcribe speech to text with offline models (WhisperKit or Parakeet) or cloud-based Gemini API, capture and transcribe screen recordings with visual context, and read selected text aloud with Gemini Live. Fast, accurate, and simple.

- Press Command+Option+S again while reading to cancel the operation
- Sequential streaming for smooth, natural speech with minimal latency
- Smart sentence splitting for optimal speech flow

**Screen Recording & Video Transcription**
- Press Command+Option+C to start/stop screen recording
- Automatic video transcription using Gemini 2.5 Flash API with visual context
- Better accuracy for programming terms, code, technical jargon, and ambiguous words
- Transcribed text automatically pastes at cursor position

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15+ or Xcode Command Line Tools (for Swift 5.9+)
- Gemini API key (for text-to-speech and video transcription)
- ffmpeg (for screen recording functionality)

## System Permissions Setup

This app requires specific system permissions to function properly:

### 1. Microphone Access
The app will automatically request microphone permission on first launch. If denied, grant it manually:
- Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone**
- Enable access for **Super Voice Assistant**

### 2. Accessibility Access (Required for Global Hotkeys & Auto-Paste)
You must manually grant accessibility permissions for the app to:
- Monitor global keyboard shortcuts (Command+Option+Z/S/X/A/V/C, Escape)
- Automatically paste transcribed text at cursor position

**To enable:**
1. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
2. Click the lock icon to make changes (enter your password)
3. Click the **+** button to add an application
4. Navigate to the app location:
   - If running via `swift run`: Add **Terminal** or your terminal app (iTerm2, etc.)
   - If running the built binary directly: Add the **SuperVoiceAssistant** executable
5. Ensure the checkbox next to the app is checked

**Important:** Without accessibility access, the app cannot detect global hotkeys (Command+Option+Z/X/A/S/C/V, Escape) or paste text automatically.

### 3. Screen Recording Access (Required for Video Transcription)
The app requires screen recording permission to capture screen content:
- Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording**
- Enable access for **Terminal** (if running via `swift run`) or **SuperVoiceAssistant**

## Installation & Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/super-voice-assistant.git
cd super-voice-assistant

# Install ffmpeg (required for screen recording)
brew install ffmpeg

# Set up environment (for TTS and video transcription)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY

# Build the app
swift build

# Run the main app
swift run SuperVoiceAssistant
```

The app will appear in your menu bar as a waveform icon.

## Configuration

### Text Replacements

You can configure automatic text replacements for transcriptions by editing `config.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "textReplacements": {
    "Cloud Code": "Claude Code",
    "cloud code": "claude code",
    "cloud.md": "CLAUDE.md"
  }
}
```

This is useful for correcting common speech-to-text misrecognitions, especially for proper nouns, brand names, or technical terms. Replacements are case-sensitive and applied to all transcriptions.

## Usage

### Voice-to-Text Transcription

**Local (Cmd+Option+Z):**
1. Launch the app - it appears in the menu bar
2. Open Settings to select and download a model (Parakeet or WhisperKit)
3. Press **Command+Option+Z** to start recording
4. Press **Command+Option+Z** again to stop and transcribe
5. Text automatically pastes at cursor
6. Press **Escape** to cancel

**Cloud (Cmd+Option+X):**
1. Set GEMINI_API_KEY in your .env file
2. Press **Command+Option+X** to start/stop recording
3. Text automatically pastes at cursor

**Transcription engines:**
- **Parakeet v2**: ~110x realtime, 1.69% WER, English - recommended for speed
- **Parakeet v3**: ~210x realtime, 1.8% WER, 25 languages
- **WhisperKit**: Various model sizes, good accuracy, more language options
- **Gemini**: Cloud-based, best for complex audio, requires internet

### Text-to-Speech
1. Select any text in any application
2. Press **Command+Option+S** to read the selected text aloud
3. Press **Command+Option+S** again while reading to cancel the operation
4. The app uses Gemini Live API for natural, streaming speech synthesis
5. Configure audio devices via Settings for optimal playback

### Screen Recording & Video Transcription
1. Press **Command+Option+C** to start screen recording
2. The menu bar shows "🎥 REC" while recording
3. Press **Command+Option+C** again to stop recording
4. The app automatically transcribes the video using Gemini 2.5 Flash
5. Visual context improves accuracy for code, technical terms, and homophones
6. Transcribed text pastes at your cursor position
7. Video file is automatically deleted after successful transcription

**Note:** Audio recording and screen recording are mutually exclusive - you cannot run both simultaneously.

**When to use video vs audio:**
- **Video**: Programming, code review, technical documentation, names, acronyms, specialized terminology
- **Audio**: General speech, quick notes, casual transcription

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Command+Option+Z**: Start/stop audio recording and transcribe (WhisperKit - offline)
- **Command+Option+X**: Start/stop audio recording and transcribe (Gemini - cloud)
- **Command+Option+S**: Read selected text aloud / Cancel TTS playback
- **Command+Option+C**: Start/stop screen recording and transcribe
- **Command+Option+A**: Show transcription history window
- **Command+Option+V**: Paste last transcription at cursor
- **Escape**: Cancel audio recording (when recording is active)
